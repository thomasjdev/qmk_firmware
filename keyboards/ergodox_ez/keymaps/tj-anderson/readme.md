# Thomas' Configuration

## Features I like about this layout

* Hyper key tap/toggle with tilde in upper left corner & one-shot hyper key after the 5 key
* CMD+Space key quickly accessible with either thumb for OS X Launchers (Alfred, Launchbar, Spotlight)
* Other comon mac shortcut combos added in the thumb cluster. Alt+Cmd on the right & Shift+Cmd on the left
* Leader key added to the bottom left which seems to be a good spot as that key is not the most convienent to reach during normal typing for me
* Left & Right shift keys are one-shot mods
* L2 key changes to my control layer with VIM mapping for arrow keys
* L2 has some other control features for media/volume control and some common mac shortcuts

## Work in progress

I find myself hardly using layer 3 & 4 so that will likely changes

Layer 3's ultimate purpose was to handle basic mouse navigation on the left board and cursor navigation on the right. 
In practice I find that I hardly use this layer
